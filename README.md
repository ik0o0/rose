# Rose â€” Proof of Concept

_A lightweight and modular file storage server_

---

**Rose** is a work-in-progress: a file storage system focused on clarity, simplicity, and adaptability.

This **proof of concept** serves to explore and test key architecture choices.

### Technologies used

- Bun
- TypeScript
- Express
- TypeORM
- SQLite
- JWT (authentication)

---

## Looking ahead

Rose is being designed to support a variety of use cases, from minimal local setups to more advanced, privacy-respecting deployments.

Planned directions include:

- Server-side only (no JavaScript), privacy-first variants
- A unified CLI for installation and configuration
- Modular builds (lightweight, corporate, privacy-oriented)
- Native reimplementation

---

_This is only the beginning. Rose will grow thoughtfully, step by step._
