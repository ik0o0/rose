# Rose â€” Proof of Concept  
*A lightweight and modular file storage server*

---

**Rose** is a work-in-progress: a file storage system focused on clarity, simplicity, and adaptability.

This **proof of concept** serves to explore and test key architecture choices.

### Technologies used

- Bun  
- TypeScript  
- Express  
- TypeORM  
- SQLite  
- JWT (authentication)

---

## Looking ahead

Rose is being designed to support a variety of use cases, from minimal local setups to more advanced, privacy-respecting deployments.

Planned directions include:

- Server-side only (no JavaScript), privacy-first variants  
- A unified CLI for installation and configuration  
- Modular builds (lightweight, corporate, privacy-oriented)  
- Native reimplementation

---

*This is only the beginning. Rose will grow thoughtfully, step by step.*
